# AlgoArena
This repository provides solutions to various programming problems, primarily focused on data structures and algorithms, and structured by problem numbers. The solutions cover a range of challenges including linked list operations, binary trees, bit manipulation, and array handling.

Key topics include:
- **Linked Lists**: Problems like merging two sorted lists and detecting cycles in a linked list.
- **Binary Trees**: Solutions for tree traversal, constructing trees from traversal orders, calculating tree depth, and finding path sums.
- **Array Manipulation**: Includes tasks like removing duplicates, searching and inserting in sorted arrays, and handling rotations.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Problems focus on reversing bits and counting binary ones, which are fundamental in low-level programming and optimization tasks.
- **Other Algorithms**: Includes solutions for finding minimum subarrays, inverting binary trees, and calculating the minimum absolute difference in binary search trees (BSTs).

This collection is ideal for practicing a range of fundamental algorithmic skills, covering basics like arrays and lists to more complex tree manipulations and binary operations. Each solution provides an efficient approach to common programming tasks, making this repository a valuable resource for interview preparation and algorithmic problem-solving practice.
